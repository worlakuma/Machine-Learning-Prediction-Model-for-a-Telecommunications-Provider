    "##### **Project Background:** In the ever-evolving telecommunication sector, retaining customers and accurately forecasting churn is essential for sustaining growth and profitability. This project seeks to harness advanced classification models to deliver a thorough understanding of customer behaviour for a prominent telecommunication company.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Project Objective:** The project will focus on three core areas:\n",
    "- Advanced Churn Prediction: We will develop and implement machine learning models to predict which customers are likely to leave the network. \n",
    "    This involves identifying critical signals and patterns that precede churn, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Lifetime Value Calculation: By estimating the lifetime value of each customer, we can provide actionable insights into the long-term revenue each customer brings. \n",
    "    This analysis will help prioritize efforts on high-value customers and inform targeted marketing and retention initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysis of Churn Influencing Factors: Identifying the key factors that drive customers to leave the network is crucial for mitigating churn. \n",
    "    The project will examine various customer metrics and behaviours to uncover the primary reasons behind churn, allowing for strategic improvements in customer service and satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this initiative, the telecommunication company will gain a deeper, data-driven understanding of its customer base, enabling more effective decision-making to enhance customer loyalty and drive sustained business success.\n",
    " \n",
    "##### **Stakeholders:**\n",
    "-Vodafon\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key metrics and success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Model should have accuracy scores of 85% (on balance data)\n",
    "- Good models are expected to have an F1 score of > 80%\n",
    "- An ROC Curve of 80% is ideal for the model to generalise well\n",
    "- There should be a minimum of 4 Baseline models\n",
    "- All hyperparameter tuning should only be applied to the Baseline models if they exceed their F1 score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Features/Columns:**\n",
    "- customerID\n",
    "- gender: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No)\n",
    "- SeniorCitizen: Whether a customer is a senior citizen or not\n",
    "- Partner\n",
    "- Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No)\n",
    "- tenure:  Number of months the customer has stayed with the company\n",
    "- PhoneService: Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No)\n",
    "- MultipleLines\n",
    "- InternetService\n",
    "- OnlineSecurity\n",
    "- OnlineBackup\n",
    "- DeviceProtection\n",
    "- TechSupport\n",
    "- StreamingTV\n",
    "- StreamingMovies\n",
    "- Contract: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-Month, One year, Two year)\n",
    "- PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No)\n",
    "- PaymentMethod\n",
    "- MonthlyCharges\n",
    "- TotalCharges\n",
    "- Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Hypothesis:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Null Hypothesis (H0):**\n",
    "There is no statistical significant relationship between churn rate and the contract term of the customer\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Alternate Hypothesis (H1):**\n",
    "There is a statistical significance relationship between churn rate and the contract term of the customer\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key Business Questions:**\n",
    "- What is the churn rate for customers with only Phone_service\n",
    "- Is there a corelation between customers' ternure and churn?\n",
    "- Does the type of contract affect the probability of churn?\n",
    "- How does the customer payment_method vary with the churn rate?\n",
